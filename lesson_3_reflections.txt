When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    For communication with the outside world, in a remote repository developers can collaborate between each other.
    Other people can see and use your changes and you can see and use changes that others have made so far.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I can be focus in what I want change, and when the change is ready
     push it. Then I'll probably have to focus on fix conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a clone on GitHub server, clone is a copy of a repository from
    GitHub to your local computer, or from your local computer to you local
    computer and branch is within a repository a new line of development, that
    allow you work in new features independently without affect the main line.
