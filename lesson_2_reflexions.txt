1- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden file is going to be created, to keep
track of the  repository history(store metadata). We need to do that because with
out a repository we would not be able to keep track of our file history. Each
git repository is tied to specific directory

2- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
 
 The staging area is where we put files that are going to be committed, you can have 
 only the change that represent a logical commit. 
 
 Repository: Initially all git repositories are empty, and you have to go and add file
 to file in the repository with add command.
 git add file

 Commit: is a snapshot of every file in the project at the time you commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

3- We have changes in different files, then we put in the staging area
only the files that you want logical commit (or we can make all the changes that
are going to meaningful, then put it in the staging area, so that files
are ready to be commit because they represent a logical change.)

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
 organized? How would branches help?

4- If we want add a new feature in our project,a different version for specific
purpose, work in a new version of the project based in the old version but we dont want affect
the original project(keep it running). 
 
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it
in the diagram the way we do?

5-The result of merging two branches is a new branch(commit), that have all
change that were made in both(the combination of both).

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs.
always doing merges manually?

6-Manually merge let us the opportunity to merge when our work is done, if we finished the features 
we were working on and no before, if we totally fix the bug. That way reduces conflict and we can review and test
our changes before merge.
