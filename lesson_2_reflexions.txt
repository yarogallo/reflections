1- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when we initialize a repository, a hidden file is going to be created, to keep
track of the  repository history(store metadata). We need to do that because with
out a repository we would not be able to keep track of our file history. each
git repository is tied to specific directory

2- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
 the staging area is where you put files that is going to be committed, in the
 directory or repository you have all your projects files. The staging area is
 helpful because you can have the only the files that you want to commit. Only
 the files that have changes.

 Ideas: Initially all git repository is empty, and you have to go and add file
 to file in the repository with add command
 git add file
