What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when we initialize a repository, a hidden file is going to be created, to keep
track of the  repository history(store metadata). We need to do that because with
out a repository we would not be able to keep track of our file history. each
git repository is tied to specific directory
